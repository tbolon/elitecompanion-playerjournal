# Elite Companion Player Journal Library

This library is a simple implementation of the [Elite Dangerous Player Journal format](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/275151-Commanders-log-manual-and-data-sample/page46) in .net.

It aims to provide a simple way for .NET developers to be able to read player journal format.

For now, it is used in a private project (.net core console app).
